    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Very simple and delicious italian sauce based on the traditional "cacio e pepe" sauce, but with the addition of egg yolks and bacon or pancetta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (2 per person)</li>
        <li>Parmesan or Percorino</li>
        <li>Bacon or Pancetta</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You can start by boiling the pasta water while you do the other steps of the recipe.</li>
        <li>While the water is getting hot, you should break 2 eggs per person, keep the egg yolks and throw the egg whites away. Mix the egg yolks with some 
            grated parmesan or pecorino until they get mixed together as one.</li>
        <li>Cut the bacon or pancetta in little cubes and fry them in a pan until they are brown.</li>
        <li>When the pasta water is boiling, cook the pasta al dente, mix the pasta with a little bit of the pasta water with the bacon, and then mix the 
            egg+parmesan mix, pay attention to keep the temperature low enough so the eggs don`t cook.</li>
    </ol>
