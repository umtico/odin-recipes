        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Classic french milk-based sauce, very smooth and neutral sauce, you can use with a lot of types of pasta and mix with different sauces.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Wheat flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First we will prepare the roux, a very classic french thickener, to decide how much roux we are going to make, the amount is usually 
                decided like this: we are going to use 10% of the weight of the amount of milk that we are using as measure to do the roux, half of that weight 
                is for butter, and the other half is for the wheat flour. So if we use 1 liter of milk, we are going to make 100 grams of roux, 50g of butter, 
                50g of flour. You can use more percentage of roux if you want, but usually the recipe uses 10% of roux.</li>
            <li>Once we decide how much sauce we will make, we make the roux, you start by melting the butter on a saucepan, once the butter is all melted, 
                you add all the wheat flour and mix them, the roux is ready in about 2 or 3 minutes on medium heat, is recommended to always keep the heat
                on medium.</li>
            <li>When the roux is done, you are going to add little amounts of the milk and mix it with the roux till they are one, keep adding little amounts
                of milk till it is done.</li>
            <li>At the end, you add salt, some black pepper and usually nutmeg, it goes very well with milk-based sauces.</li>
        </ol>
